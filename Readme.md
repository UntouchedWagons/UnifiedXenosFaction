This is a faction mod for Rimworld, specifically the BioTech DLC. In my opinion, the game and some modders do a poor job of integrating xenotypes into the game. Some xenotypes have their own dedicated faction and only show up in those factions. This works but is less than ideal. Some xenotypes won't show up at all (Archons, Fungoid, Seraph and Nephilim for example).

So I decided to solve that. It's not a perfect solution since I'm a novice at Rimworld modding. This mod adds a pirate faction made up of the base game xenotypes\*, as well as xenotypes from a bunch of other mods. All xenotypes have an equal chance of appearing and appear using typical raider equipment.

\* At the time xenotypes like Sanguophages, Genies and Hussars won't show up. I could be persauded to change my mind.
